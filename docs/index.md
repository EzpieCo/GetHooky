> *The art of forgetting to run the linter isn't old* - wise old programmer, 2025

Ever forgot to run the linter before doing a git push to production?

Not anymore!

GetHooky will make sure you don't screw up again!

Automatically **test** and **lint** your code upon doing a commit or git push!

## Why GetHooky?

Most tools for git hook mangement are mostly language specific and work for specific languages only, or you either have to do crazy configurations.

But with GetHooky, all you have to do is, install once, use as many time as you want. Because it's a CLI tool and not a package.

## Features

- Cross-platform(might mess up with Windows)
- Works on any project irrespective of Language
- Super easy to work with... literally
- All git hooks will work
